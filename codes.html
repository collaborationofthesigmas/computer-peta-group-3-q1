                <p>Super Typhoon "Enteng", a category 5 typhoon originating from a low pressure area that formed approximately 540 km (330 mi) northwest of Palau. The system was classified as a tropical storm and named Yagi by the Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA). After making landfall over Casiguran, Aurora, in the Philippines, Enteng(Yagi) weakened as it moved inland through the rugged terrain of the Cordillera Central of Luzon. It later emerged over the West Philippine Sea and began merging with a secondary circulation west of the Lingayen Gulf. The JMA reported that the storm reached its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a central pressure of 915 hPa (27.02 inHg). It subsequently peaked as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with one-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph).</p>
                <p>In preparation for Yagi, the Philippines suspended classes in Metro Manila and multiple provinces across Luzon and Visayas on September 2 and 3, multiple domestic flights were canceled, and forced evacuations were ordered. In China, schools were closed across Hainan Province on September 5 and suspensions to local transport and shipping occurred the following day, evacuations were also ordered. Hong Kong Observatory issued a Standby Signal No.1 warning over Hong Kong as Yagi approached the territory at the strength of a Category 4 typhoon, multiple flights and trading in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was cancelled. Macau cancelled multiple flights, and classes were suspended. Vietnam temporarily suspended flight operations, suspended classes, rail way systems were suspended, and made multiple advisories in anticipation of the impact of Typhoon Yagi. </p>
                <p>This Typhoon singlehandedly caused great damages to multiple countries such as Philippines, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. In response to the severe effects of Typhoon Yagi, the United States pledged US$1 million in immediate humanitarian aid, while the Australian government allocated AUD$3 million (US$2 million) for emergency assistance and crucial services. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation committed US$1.17 million, sending six specialists to aid in the recovery efforts. The European Union has provided €2.2 million (US$2.6 million) in humanitarian aid, with €1.2 million (US$1.42 million) directed to Myanmar, €650,000 (US$768,755) to Vietnam, €200,000 (US$236,540) to the Philippines, and €150,000 (US$177,405) to Laos, to support those most affected by Typhoon Yagi.</p>
